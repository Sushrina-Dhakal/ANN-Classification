    "* Start Simple: Begin with a simple architecture and gradually increase complexity if needed.\n",
    "* Grid Search/Random Search: Use grid search or random search to try different architectures.\n",

    "* Heuristics and Rules of Thumb: Some heuristics and empirical rules can provide starting points, such as:\n",
    "    - The number of neurons in the hidden layer should be between the size of the input layer and the size of the output layer.\n",
    "    - A common pratice is to start with 1-2 hidden layers"
